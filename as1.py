#1Arithmetic Operations
#Write a program that:
'''Declares two variables a = 10 and b = 5.
Calculates and prints the result of the following operations:'''
'''Addition (a + b)
Subtraction (a - b)
Multiplication (a * b)
Division (a / b)
Modulus (a % b)'''

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)

#2.Area of a Circle
'''Write a program that:

Declares a variable radius = 7.
Calculates the area of a circle using the formula area = π * radius² (use 3.14 for π).
Prints the area of the circle.'''

r = 7
π = 3.14
print(π * r * r)

#3. Comparison Operators
'''Write a program that:

Declares two variables x = 15 and y = 20.
Checks and prints the result of the following comparisons:'''
x = 15
y = 20

print(x > 20 and 15 < y) 
print(15 < 20) 
print(x==y)
print(x!=y)
print(x >= 10 and y <= 25)

#4.Swap Two Variables
'''Write a program to:

Declare two variables a = 3 and b = 7.
Swap their values without using a third variable.
Print the new values of a and b.
'''


d = 3
s = 7
# d=s
s=d
print(d)


#5. Simple Interest Calculation
'''Write a program that:'''



principal=5000
rate =  5
time = 2
SI = (principal * rate * time) / 100
print(SI)
